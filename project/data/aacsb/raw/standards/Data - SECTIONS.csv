1,Strategic Managemend and Innovation,"Strategic management encompasses the entire range of activities in which a school engages to 
fulfill its mission and informs the school on resource management. The primary documentation is 
the strategic plan, which all accredited schools are expected to have as a principal artifact for the 
peer review team to examine. The strategic plan provides a basis for the composition of the 
school’s intellectual contribution portfolio, the identification of peer groups, and the school’s 
aspirations. The strategic plan identifies the school’s mission, strategic initiatives, goals, objectives, 
tactics, and metrics for success and is created with input from key stakeholders.  
Ensuring financial vitality from both an operational and strategic perspective is also a critical part of 
strategic management. Additionally, an important component of an AACSB-accredited institution is 
how the school will contribute meaningfully both to connecting business education with business 
practice and to fostering and promoting societal impact consistent with AACSB’s vision.  
This section provides standards that guide business schools in the process of meaningful strategic 
management, including standards around the creation and maintenance of a strategic plan, 
management of all resources, and ensuring overall financial health of the accredited school or unit."
2,Learner Success,"This section of the accreditation standards is designed to ensure the success of learners in the 
school’s degree programs and other learning experiences provided by the school. The standards in 
this section address these critical areas of teaching and learning.  
High-quality business schools have processes for ensuring that learners will acquire the 
competencies to achieve successful outcomes in line with the mission of the school and develop a 
lifelong learning mindset to ensure continued success. These processes include curriculum and 
program management informed by systematic assurance of learning. Schools should have 
assessment processes in the portfolio of assurance of learning tools that will ensure the currency 
and relevancy of the business curriculum. Competency goals should be designed and assessed to 
maximize the potential for achieving expected outcomes. Teaching should be linked to competency 
goals, and processes should be in place to ensure that faculty are delivering a high-quality 
educational experience. Curricula and extracurricular programs should be innovative and foster 
engagement among learners, between learners and faculty, and with business practice.  "
3,"Though Leadership, Engagement, and Societal Impact","The defining feature of quality business schools is that they are making a significant difference 
through educational activities, thought leadership, and engagement with external stakeholders. 
Quality schools create and disseminate intellectual contributions that have an impact on the theory, 
practice, and/or teaching of business, and have a positive impact on society. Often these 
contributions are the result of engagement with broader society in a manner that facilitates co
creation of knowledge and ensures the relevance, usefulness, and impact of the school’s 
intellectual contributions. Achieving this impact requires a school to have a clear focus and direction 
for its thought leadership that aligns with its mission.  
Further, high-quality schools have a positive societal impact by addressing broader social, 
economic, business, and/or physical environment issues, which could be at a local, regional, 
national, or international scale. This impact results from internal and external initiatives and aligns 
with the concept of business schools being a force for good in society. Within this context, 
interdisciplinary work becomes an important means to achieving goals that have great impact on 
society. Thus, interdisciplinary work is encouraged and applauded.  
This section contains two standards. The first standard focuses on the production, dissemination, 
and impact of a school’s thought leadership as it relates to scholarship, while the second assesses 
a school’s engagement with and impact on society.  "
