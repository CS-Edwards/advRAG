1,3,Faculty and Professional Staff Resources,"STANDARD 3: FACULTY AND PROFESSIONAL STAFF RESOURCES
3.1 The school maintains and strategically deploys sufficient participating and
supporting faculty who collectively demonstrate significant academic and professional
engagement that, in turn, supports high-quality outcomes consistent with the school’s
mission.
3.2 Faculty are qualified through initial academic or professional preparation and sustain
currency and relevancy appropriate to their classification, as follows: Scholarly
Academic (SA), Practice Academic (PA), Scholarly Practitioner (SP), or Instructional
Practitioner (IP). Otherwise, faculty members are classified as Additional Faculty (A).
3.3 Sufficient professional staff are available to ensure high-quality support for faculty
and learners as appropriate.
3.4 The school has well-documented and well-communicated processes to manage,
develop, and support faculty and professional staff over the progression of their careers
that are consistent with the school’s mission, strategies, and expected outcomes. ","• A participating faculty member actively and deeply engages in the activities of the school 
in matters beyond direct teaching responsibilities. Normally, the school considers 
participating faculty members to be ongoing members of the faculty, regardless of whether 
their appointments are full-time or part-time, whether their positions with the school are 
considered their principal employment, and whether the school has tenure policies.  
• A supporting faculty member does not normally participate in the intellectual or operational 
life of the school beyond the direct performance of teaching responsibilities.  
• Research master’s degrees are degrees that focus heavily on research methods and 
independent research projects as the primary program content.  
• Faculty qualifications status refers to one of four categories designated to demonstrate 
current and relevant intellectual capital or professional engagement in the area of teaching 
to support the school’s mission and related activities. Categories for specifying faculty 
qualifications are based on both the initial academic preparation or professional 
experience, and sustained academic and professional engagement within the area of 
teaching as follows:  
− Scholarly Academics (SA) are faculty who have normally attained a terminal degree in 
a field related to the area of teaching and who sustain currency and relevancy through 
scholarship and activities related to their field of teaching. SA faculty are normally 
expected to produce some peer-or editorial-reviewed publications related to their field 
of teaching as part of their portfolio of scholarship. In addition to publications related to 
their field of teaching, SA faculty may produce other publications outside their field of 
teaching in support of other mission-related components of the school and reflective of 
the faculty member’s role at the school.  
− Practice Academics (PA) are faculty who have normally attained a terminal degree in a 
field related to their area of teaching and who sustain currency and relevancy through 
professional engagement, interaction, and activities related to their field of teaching.  
− Scholarly Practitioners (SP) are faculty who have normally attained a master’s degree 
related to their field of teaching; have professional experience substantial in duration 
and responsibility at the time of hire; and who sustain currency and relevancy through 
scholarship related to their professional background and experience in their field of 
teaching.  
− Instructional Practitioners (IP) are faculty who have normally attained a master’s 
degree related to their field of teaching; have professional experience substantial in 
duration and responsibility at the time of hire; and who sustain currency and relevancy 
through continued professional experience and engagement related to their 
professional background and experience in their field of teaching.  
− Additional Faculty (A) are faculty who do not meet the school’s criteria for SA, PA, SP, 
or IP.  
• Professional staff include individuals who do not have faculty appointments but provide 
direct support for ancillary activities. Examples of professional staff include, but are not 
limited to, career services, learner services, admissions, alumni engagement, corporate 
engagement, instructional support, and other key mission components.  ","3.1 Faculty Sufficiency  
• A school adopts and applies criteria for documenting faculty members as ""participating"" or 
""supporting"" that are consistent with its mission. Each school should adapt this guidance 
to its particular situation and mission by developing and implementing criteria that indicate 
how the school is meeting the spirit and intent of the standard. The criteria should address 
the activities that are required to attain participating and supporting status and the depth 
and breadth of activities expected within a typical AACSB accreditation review cycle to 
maintain participating and supporting status. The criteria should be periodically reviewed 
and reflect a focus on continuous improvement.  
• Normally, participating faculty members will deliver at least 75 percent of the school’s 
teaching globally (i.e., across the entire accredited unit); participating faculty members will 
deliver at least 60 percent of the teaching within each discipline, regardless of whether the 
school has a degree, major, concentration, etc., in the discipline. Additionally, while 
participating faculty ratios are expected to be met by the discipline, they are not intended 
to be applied to degree programs, locations, and modalities. Instead, a peer review team 
would normally expect an appropriate blend of participating and supporting faculty to be 
deployed across these areas.  

• Disciplines are defined by the school in the context of their mission. Normally, the 
disciplines should align with the degree programs and/or majors offered by the school. 
However, not every degree program must have an identified discipline.  
• Instructional models such as mass lectures supported by teaching assistants, faculty not 
in residence but who may travel periodically to the school to deliver a particular program 
such as a DBA program, faculty shared across institutions, visiting faculty, and online 
program managers who deliver digital instruction should be clearly identified and 
documented as to how this method of instructional delivery leads to high-quality learning 
outcomes and high learner satisfaction.  
• In cases where a substantial proportion of a business school’s faculty resources hold 
primary faculty appointments with other institutions, the school must provide 
documentation of how this faculty model supports mission achievement, overall high 
quality, and continuous improvement, and how this model is consistent with the spirit and 
intent of this standard. In particular, the school must show that the faculty model is 
consistent with achieving the research expectations of the school.  
3.2 Faculty Qualifications  
• Faculty members can be Scholarly Academic (SA), Practice Academic (PA), Scholarly 
Practitioner (SP), or Instructional Practitioner (IP). Faculty members should be assigned 
one of these designations based on the school’s criteria for initial qualifications and 
sustained engagement activities that support currency and relevancy in their teaching 
field.

Faculty whose qualifications do not meet the criteria established by the school for 
SA, PA, SP, or IP status will be classified as “Additional” Faculty.  
Criteria for SA and PA status
For initial classification of SA or PA, a terminal degree related to their field of teaching 
is appropriate. Note that a faculty member can be considered SA or PA for five years 
from the date of conferral of the terminal degree. Doctoral students with teaching 
responsibilities who have attained all-but-dissertation (“ABD”) status will be considered 
SA for three years from the commencement of ABD status. A variety of terminal 
degrees may be appropriate where the terminal degree is related to the faculty 
member’s field of teaching.  
▪ Examples of commonly accepted terminal degrees in business include:  
• doctoral degrees in business or a closely-related business discipline (PhD or 
DBA);  
• a graduate degree in law (LLM) and/or taxation (MST) for those teaching taxation  
• a law degree (LLM, or JD) for those teaching courses or modules related to law or 
aspects related to the legal environment of business (e.g., ethics, sustainability, 
etc.).  
▪ Additional terminal degrees may also be appropriate for SA status when the degree 
is closely related to the faculty member’s field of teaching and the faculty member 
sustains currency through scholarly activities in that field consistent with this 
standard.  
▪ While unusual, a faculty member without a terminal degree may be classified as SA 
or PA, but the faculty member must clearly be engaged in sustained, substantive 
academic and/or professional engagement activities to support their currency and 
relevancy in their field of teaching and their contributions to other mission 
components; such activity is expected to be consistent with the activities in which the 
school’s other terminally-qualified SA faculty engage. The school will be expected to 
make its case for SA or PA status in such cases. AACSB expects that there will be 
only a limited number (normally not to exceed 10 percent of all faculty) of cases in 
which individuals without terminal degrees also have SA or PA status.  
33 
− Subsequent to initial classification, there must be ongoing, sustained, and substantive 
academic activities (for SA) or professional engagement activities (for PA) supporting 
qualification status.  
• Criteria for IP and SP Status 
− For initial classification of IP or SP, a master’s degree in a discipline related to the 
faculty member’s field of teaching, along with significant and substantive professional 
experience is appropriate. In limited cases, IP or SP status may be appropriate for 
individuals without master’s degrees if the depth, duration, sophistication, and 
complexity of their professional experience at the time of hiring outweighs their lack of 
master’s degree qualifications. The school will be expected to make its case for IP or 
SP status in such cases.  
− Subsequent to initial classification, there must be ongoing, sustained, and substantive 
professional engagement activities (for IP) and scholarly activities (for SP) supporting 
qualification status.  
• School Criteria 
− Each school should develop appropriate criteria and policies for the classification of 
faculty, including those faculty who also hold significant administrative appointments 
(e.g., deans, associate deans, department heads/chairs, or center directors) and 
according to initial preparation and sustained engagement activities. Criteria for such 
administrators should consider the weight relative to the individual’s administrative 
role. For example, the criteria may differentiate between a dean with significant 
administrative responsibilities vs. a department head with a smaller administrative 
workload. These criteria and policies should cover both initial classification and 
maintenance of qualified status subsequent to initial classification. Sustained 
engagement activities, including research and scholarship, should be substantially 
connected with and in support of the primary teaching responsibilities of the faculty 
member to demonstrate how the faculty member is current and relevant in their field of 
teaching. Criteria and policies should be consistent with the mission of the school and 
comparable to peer schools.  
• Discipline and Global Ratio Minimums  
− Normally, a minimum of 40 percent of a school’s faculty resources are SA and 90 
percent are SA+PA+SP+IP at the global level (i.e., across the entire accredited unit) 
and in disciplines defined by the school in alignment with degrees or majors. Where a 
school maintains generalist degrees (e.g., BBA, General Business, MBA, etc.) with 
associated concentrations/areas of focus, then areas of concentration/areas of focus 
should normally be treated like disciplines with respect to meeting ratios. Schools that 
emphasize research master’s and doctoral degree programs are expected to have 
higher percentages of SA faculty, maintain a strong focus on SA faculty, and place 
high emphasis on faculty who undertake scholarly activities to maintain SA status as 
consistent with their peer institutions and their mission.  
− The ratio of SA faculty at the discipline level may be less than the 40 percent minimum 
if the school makes appointments to drive new, innovative, or interdisciplinary 
34 
2020 GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS ACCREDITATION 
initiatives. In these instances, the burden is on the school to make its case as to how it 
maintains high-quality outcomes. Peer review judgment and discretion is called upon 
to determine when such exceptions are appropriate.  
− In disciplines where the school does not offer any degree programs or majors, the 40 
percent SA ratio is not expected as a norm since those faculty would be supporting 
other degree programs.  
− “Additional” Faculty (A) should not exceed 10 percent of the school’s overall faculty or 
within each discipline.  
− In all cases where the school does not align with the faculty sufficiency and 
qualification guidelines at the discipline (in cases where degree programs or majors 
are offered) or global level, the school must make its case through demonstration of 
high-quality, evidence-based programs, student learning outcomes, and evidence of 
learner and/or employer satisfaction as appropriate. The peer review team will 
consider such departures on a case-by-case basis and employ professional judgment 
when these guidelines are not met.  
• Faculty Deployment  
− Table 3-2 is intended to provide a snapshot of how qualified faculty are deployed 
across degree programs for the entire accredited unit in the most recently completed 
regular academic year. Because Table 3-2 documents only a portion of the faculty 
member’s contribution to the school’s mission—the teaching component—schools are 
not required to meet the 40 percent SA ratio used to calculate faculty qualifications in 
Table 3-1, which includes all activities in which a faculty member engages (i.e., 
teaching, research, service, other) to contribute to the mission of the school. However, 
schools are expected to meet the 90 percent SA+PA+SP+IP ratio across degree 
programs for Table 3-2 in order to validate that the school deploys qualified faculty 
across degree levels.  
− The deployment of the school’s blend of SA, PA, SP, and IP faculty members must 
result from a strategic choice by the school and be consistent with the school’s 
mission and strategic initiatives, and be carried out in a way that promotes high-quality 
learner success and achievement of learning competencies in all programs, locations, 
and modalities. While AACSB does not prescribe SA deployment percentages by 
program, location, or modality, a peer review team would normally expect a blend of 
faculty across degree programs, locations, and modalities and take into consideration 
the level of degree programs offered at other locations and in various modalities, 
where such distinction is appropriate. Additionally, research master’s degrees and 
doctoral degrees everywhere should reflect a faculty complement with qualifications 
consistent with what is needed to provide high-quality experiences and outcomes to 
these learners. High-quality outcomes can be demonstrated through assurance of 
learning data provided by degree program.  
− Table 3-2 is prepared at a macro-level across all degree programs, locations, and 
modalities; however, peer review teams may request supplemental breakout of Table 
3-2 by a particular location or modality, where appropriate, as determined by the team. 
35 
2020 GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS ACCREDITATION 
It is recognized that blended modalities are becoming increasingly common; therefore, 
modality in and of itself is often not a necessary breakout. Nevertheless, if the peer 
review team deems it appropriate to view Table 3-2 by modality, it is within their 
discretion to request the table for a particular location or by modality.  
3.3 Professional Staff Sufficiency  
• Sufficient professional staff are maintained to support instructional, technological and 
learner support needs on an ongoing basis, regardless of whether they are housed in the 
business school or centralized within a larger, shared unit such as the university.

2,4,Curriculum,"STANDARD 4: CURRICULUM 4.1 The school delivers content that is current, relevant, forward-looking, globallyoriented, aligned with program competency goals, and consistent with its mission, strategies, and expected outcomes. The curriculum content cultivates agility with current and emerging technologies. 4.2 The school manages its curriculum through assessment and other systematic review processes to ensure currency, relevancy, and competency. 4.3 The school’s curriculum promotes and fosters innovation, experiential learning, and a lifelong learning mindset. Program elements promoting positive societal impact are included within the curriculum. 4.4 The school’s curriculum facilitates meaningful learner-to-learner and learnerto-faculty academic and professional engagement.","• A curriculum is composed of program content, pedagogies (teaching methods, delivery 
modes), and structures (how the content is organized and sequenced to create a 
systematic, integrated program of teaching and learning), and identifies how the school 
facilitates achievement of program competency goals. A curriculum is influenced by the 
mission, values, and culture of the school.  

• Curriculum content includes theories, ideas, concepts, skills, and knowledge that 
collectively make up a degree program.

 • Competencies state the educational expectations for each degree program. They specify 
the intellectual and behavioral capabilities a program is intended to instill, as well as the 
knowledge, skills, and abilities expected as an outcome of a particular program. In 
defining these competencies, faculty members clarify how they intend for graduates to be 
competent and effective as a result of completing the program. Not all content areas need 
to be included as competency goals. Competency goals should be aligned with the 
mission of the school.  
• Experiential learning includes a wide variety of activities such as internships, service 
learning, study abroad, consulting projects, and other high-impact pedagogical practices.  
• Curriculum management refers to the school’s processes and organization for 
development, design, and implementation of each degree program’s structure, 
organization, content, assessment of outcomes, pedagogy, etc. Curriculum management 
captures input from key business school stakeholders and is influenced by assurance of 
learning results, new developments in business practices and issues, and revision of 
mission and strategy that relate to new areas of instruction.  
• An innovative curriculum may be exhibited by incorporating cutting-edge or creative 
content or technologies and varied pedagogies and/or delivery methods.  ","4.1 Curriculum Content  
• Contents of degree program curricula result from effective curriculum management 
processes and include relevant competencies that prepare graduates for business careers 
and foster a lifelong learning mindset.  
• All business degree programs include an understanding of, and appreciation for, cultural 
norms across various regions and countries and how such differences impact managerial 
decision-making.  
• Curriculum should reflect current and innovative business theories and practices.  
• Normally, business degree programs at the bachelor’s level include learning experiences 
that address core competencies characteristic of a successful business graduate of an 
AACSB-accredited school, as well as content from business disciplines, such as 
accounting, economics, finance, management, management information systems, 
marketing, and quantitative methods.  
15 Non-degree programs (e.g., non-degree executive education, certificates, minors, etc.) are not intended to be covered by this standard. Refer to 
Standard 5 for a discussion of assurance of learning for such programs. 

• Graduate degree programs will have higher-order learning experiences, such as synthesis 
and integration of information.  
• Specialized business master’s degree programs normally include an understanding of the 
specified discipline from multiple perspectives, an understanding of the specialization 
context, and preparation for careers or further study.  
• General business master’s degrees ordinarily include preparation for leading an 
organization, managing in a diverse global context, thinking creatively, making sound 
decisions and exercising good judgment under uncertainty, and integrating knowledge 
across fields.  
• Doctoral degree programs normally include advanced research knowledge and skills, an 
understanding of specialization context, and preparation for faculty responsibilities or 
positions outside academia. Doctoral degree programs include an appreciation for the 
production of research that contributes positively to society. Doctoral degree programs 
intended to prepare learners for academic positions devote significant time in the program

2,5,Assurance of Learning,"STANDARD 5: ASSURANCE OF LEARNING
5.1 The school uses well-documented assurance of learning (AoL) processes that
include direct and indirect measures for ensuring the quality of all degree programs
that are deemed in scope for accreditation purposes. The results of the school’s
AoL work leads to curricular and process improvements.
5.2 Programs resulting in the same degree credential are structured and designed to
ensure equivalence of high-quality outcomes irrespective of location and modality
of instructional delivery.
5.3 Microlearning credentials that are “stackable” or otherwise able to be combined
into an AACSB-accredited degree program should include processes to ensure high
quality and continuous improvement.
5.4 Non-degree executive education that generates greater than five percent of a
school’s total annual resources should include processes to ensure high quality
and continuous improvement. ","• Assurance of learning (AoL) refers to the systematic processes and assessment plans 
that collectively demonstrate that learners achieve learning competencies for the 
programs in which they participate that are within the scope of the school’s accreditation. 
AoL also includes the processes of identifying competency gaps and designing and 
implementing changes to the curriculum and learning experience so the learning 
competencies are met. AACSB accreditation is concerned with broad, program-level, 
focused competency goals for each degree program, rather than detailed competency 
goals by course or topic.  
• Competency-based education (CBE) refers to courses where learners progress at their 
own pace, based on their ability to demonstrate proficiency with a specific skill or 
competency. CBE includes credit for prior learning.  
• Direct measures refer to evidence from learner work such as examinations, quizzes, 
assignments, and internship or externship feedback that is based on direct observation of 
individual performance behaviors or outcomes.  
• Indirect measures of learning refer to evidence attained from third-party input that is not 
based on direct observation of individual performance behaviors or outcomes. For 
example, an employer survey asking for an assessment of how a school’s learners have 
performed on internships relative to learners from peer institutions is an indirect measure. 
However, a learner who completes an internship for degree credit and is assessed by the 
company on individual performance, with such feedback provided to the school, is a direct 
measure. Examples of indirect assessments include exit surveys, alumni surveys, 
advisory council feedback, employer input, career fair feedback, inspection of course 
documentation, external outcome measures, focus groups, and interviews. As with direct 
assessments, indirect assessment should be supportive of the competency goals of the 
particular degree program, including the successful achievement of those competency 
goals.  
• Executive education refers to educational activities that typically do not lead to a degree 
but have educational objectives at a level consistent with higher education in business. 
Examples include corporate training or professional development seminars. Where 
executive education programs are degree-granting, normal assurance of learning 
processes and other standards apply.  
• Competencies throughout this standard is understood to broadly encompass knowledge, 
skills, and abilities.  
• Microlearning credentials are certifications granted by assessment of mastery of a 
specialized competency. Such credentials may sometimes be “stackable,” or combined to 
collectively satisfy the requirements of a degree program. Minors, certificates, and badges 
are common microlearning credentials.  ","5.1 Assurance of Learning Processes  
• The school identifies learning competencies for each business degree program as well as 
appropriate direct and indirect measures that are systematically assessed to demonstrate 
that learning competencies are achieved across degree programs.  
• Competencies derive from and are consonant with the school's mission, strategies, and 
expected outcomes and are reported at the degree level, as opposed to the major level.  
• Competencies and curriculum management processes reflect currency of knowledge and 
expectations of stakeholders, including but not limited to organizations employing 
graduates, alumni, learners, the university community, and policymakers.  
• Competencies are largely achieved. Where competencies are not achieved, the school 
provides evidence of actions taken to remediate the deficiencies.  
• Both direct and indirect measures are employed; a school is expected to include both 
types of measures across the entire portfolio of assessment of all its degree programs. 
The proportion of direct versus indirect measures by degree program is determined by 
each school, consistent with its mission and strategic initiatives. It is acceptable for some 
programs to be assessed only through direct measures, while other programs may be 
assessed through only indirect measures. The school provides its rationale for 
determining which programs are measured through direct measures and which programs 
are measured through indirect measures.  
• Results of regular direct and indirect assessment should lead to curricular and process 
improvements.  
• The school employs a systematic AoL process that includes meaningful and broad faculty 
participation.  
 
• Programs launched since the last review should have a robust AoL plan in place, 
including a timeline for gathering and analyzing data. Depending on how long the program 
has been offered, some data may or may not have yet been gathered. A program that has 
been offered for five years would be expected to have gathered sufficient data to 
demonstrate a systematic and effective process for the program; however, a program just 
launched one or two years before a normal peer review visit may not have yet gathered 
sufficient data to demonstrate a systematic and effective process. The standards intend 
that, in the case of a newly launched degree program, schools should be given sufficient 
time to establish a systematic assessment process that adequately demonstrates student 
learning; in such a case, a robust assessment plan is of paramount importance.  
5.2 Degree Equivalency  
• Expectations for learner effort and outcomes for the same degree credentials are 
equivalent in terms of depth and rigor, regardless of delivery mode or location.  
• If competency-based education (CBE) credit is awarded by the school, normally the 
equivalent quality is assured via direct assessment of learners. CBE credit should reflect a 
small percentage of the total academic program.  
5.3 Stackable Microlearning Credentials  
• Credentials such as certificates, minors, and badges that lead to a degree program will be 
evaluated at the degree program level.  
5.4 Non-Degree Executive Education  
• Non-degree executive education should normally be reviewed for overall quality, 
continuous improvement, and customer/client satisfaction if such programs generate 
greater than five percent of a school’s annual resources.  ","5.1 Assurance of Learning Processes  
• For each degree program provide a portfolio of evidence across degree programs that 
includes direct and indirect assessment of learning, showing learner progress in meeting 
competency goals for each business degree program. The proportion of direct versus 
indirect measures within each degree program is determined by each school, consistent 
with its mission and strategic initiatives. Examples of programs that lend themselves to 
indirect measurement only are programs that are newer, smaller, niche, specialized, and 
interdisciplinary programs, or programs very closely tied to professional fields. Indirect 
evidence should be relative to the competencies stated for the degree program to which 
indirect evidence is applied. Schools in the initial accreditation process should complete 
Table 5-1 for each degree program. The table is optional for schools in the continuous 
improvement review process.  
• Where assessment demonstrates that learners are not meeting learning competencies, 
describe efforts the school has instituted to improve such learning outcomes.  

• Provide evidence that faculty are sufficiently and meaningfully engaged in AoL processes.  
• If the business school is subject to formalized regional or country regulations or quality 
assurance organizations focused on the evaluation of learner performance, and these 
processes are consistent with AACSB expectations and best practices
relevant or 
redundant portions may be applied to demonstrate assurance of learning. The burden of 
proof is on the school to document that these systems support effective continuous 
improvement in learner performance and outcomes. Consult the mentor or peer review 
team chair for further guidance.  
5.2 Degree Equivalency  
• Show that degree program structure and design expectations are appropriate to the level 
of degree programs and demonstrate that expectations across educational programs that 
result in the same degree credentials are equivalent, regardless of delivery mode, 
location, or time to completion.  
• Be prepared to provide evidence of equivalent learning outcomes for identical degrees 
offered at different locations or in different modalities. Examples may include, but are not 
limited to, assurance of learning outcomes, graduation rates, retention rates, placement 
rates, employer and alumni surveys, and learner satisfaction statistics.  
5.3 Stackable Microlearning Credentials  
• Provide a list of microlearning credentials that may be stacked into a degree and describe 
how the portfolio of microlearning credentials is aligned with the school’s mission and 
strategy.  
• Explain how these credentials may lead to a degree and describe how quality is assured 
for these microlearning credentials.  
5.4 Non-Degree Executive Education  
• Describe the portfolio of executive education programs and how the portfolio is aligned 
with the school’s mission and strategy.  
• Provide a narrative discussing how the school ensures high-quality processes and 
outcomes in its executive education offerings in cases where a school’s non-degree 
executive education revenue exceeds five percent of the school’s total annual resources.  
• Describe processes for ensuring that client expectations are consistently met.

• Apart from collaborative provision programs, normally the majority of learning in business 
disciplines that count toward degree fulfillment (as determined by credits, contact hours, 
or other metrics) is earned through the institution awarding the degree. In this context, 
business disciplines do not include general education courses but do include courses in 
the major, required business courses, and business electives.

3,8,Impact of Scholarship,"STANDARD 8: IMPACT OF SCHOLARSHIP 8.1 The school’s faculty collectively produce high-quality, impactful intellectual contributions that, over time, develop into mission-consistent areas of thought leadership for the school. 8.2 The school collaborates with a wide variety of external stakeholders to create and transfer credible, relevant, and timely knowledge that informs the theory, policy, and/or practice of business to develop into mission-consistent areas of thought leadership for the school. 8.3 The school’s portfolio of intellectual contributions contains exemplars of basic, applied, and/or pedagogical research that have had a positive societal impact, consistent with the school’s mission.","""Society in this context refers to external stakeholders of relevance to the business school 
given its mission. Examples include nonprofit and private-sector organizations; business, 
government, and community groups; and the broader social, economic, business, and 
physical environments. These external stakeholders and broader environments may be at 
a local, regional, national, or international scale.  

Thought leadership is evidenced when a business school is recognized as a highly 
respected authority in an area or areas of expertise, and is thus sought after by relevant 
stakeholders. Aligned with the school’s mission, these stakeholders should include 
learners, business, academics, government, nonprofits, non-governmental organizations, 
and/or broader society.  

Predatory journals and publishers are defined as “entities that prioritize self-interest at the 
expense of scholarship and/or are characterized by false or misleading information; 
deviation from best editorial and publication practices; a lack of transparency; and/or the 
use of aggressive and indiscriminate solicitation practices.” (18 Definition adopted from “Predatory Journals: no definition, no defence.” (Nature 2019, December 11). Retrieved from 
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y )

 Intellectual contributions are original works intended to advance the theory, practice, 
and/or teaching of business. Further, intellectual contributions may have the potential to 
address issues of importance to broader society. The contributions are scholarly in the 
sense that they are based on generally accepted academic research principles and are 
disseminated to appropriate audiences. The school’s portfolio of Intellectual contributions 
may fall into any of the following categories:

− Basic or Discovery Scholarship is directed toward increasing the knowledge base and 
the development of theory.  
− Applied or Integrative/Application Scholarship draws from basic research and uses 
accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques to solve real-world 
problems and/or issues associated with practice.  
− Teaching and Learning Scholarship explores the theory and methods of teaching and 
advances new understandings, insights, content, and methods that impact learning 
behavior.  
In addition to the categorization of intellectual contributions within the portfolio as basic, 
applied, or teaching/learning related, schools further characterize their intellectual 
contributions according to the level of peer or expert review that has occurred for the 
intellectual contributions appearing in their portfolio. For our purposes, peer-reviewed 
intellectual contributions are those that are subject to the scrutiny and evaluation of others 
who have recognized subject matter expertise in the same field, normally with a similar 
competence to those who are producing the outputs.  


This component in separated into three parts:  
− Peer-reviewed journal articles are scholarly publications that were submitted for 
critique and evaluation by one or more academics who have expertise in the discipline 
and/or methodology of the subject matter. Publications in law reviews may be included 
in this category.  
− Other peer-or editorial-reviewed intellectual contributions include forms of quality 
assurance by either peers or subject matter experts recognized as having particular 
practical or academic expertise in that field. Examples include papers submitted for an 
academic conference that undergo peer review to be selected for conference 
presentation or for publication in conference proceedings. Articles published in 
practitioner or industry publications can be included in this category if they are 
sufficiently reviewed by subject matter experts. Other intellectual contributions that are 
not journal articles but are papers sufficiently influential with public policy, government, 
or industry can be included in this category if they are sufficiently reviewed by subject 
matter experts. Simply writing a paper as an output of consulting or other work does 
not render it appropriate for this category. The review and validation by subject matter 
experts is the determining factor as to whether such an intellectual contribution 
belongs in this category or in the third category of other intellectual contributions.  
− All other intellectual contributions include outputs that are not validated by peers or 
those recognized as subject matter experts. These contributions include a wide variety 
of outputs such as presentations at academic or professional meetings, research 
workshops led, invited talks, etc. ""","8.1 The Production of High Quality, Impactful Intellectual Contributions • The school has in place processes, systems, and resources to support the production of quality intellectual contributions and assess their impact. • The school’s intellectual contributions have an impact on theory, practice, and/or teaching of business. • The school has a five-year portfolio of its intellectual contributions. The distribution of intellectual contributions across categories in the portfolio is aligned with the school’s mission, strategy, and aspirations for reputation as a thought leader. As such, the types of intellectual contributions will vary across schools just as their missions vary. • The school identifies its area(s) of thought leadership, outlines its goals for these contributions, and describes its achievements over the last five years as well as plans for the next five years. Examples of areas that could evolve into thought leadership include organizing and holding regional, national, or international academic and/or practitioner conferences; holding meetings for academic or professional organizations; publishing working-paper series; publishing academic journals; establishing a case study clearinghouse; or forming research relationships with private-sector, nonprofit, or government organizations. • One important type of intellectual contribution is the publication of high-quality peer reviewed journal articles. The production of peer review journal articles is a key way in which faculty maintain currency and expertise in their field. Thus, all schools are expected to have some high-quality peer-reviewed journal articles in their portfolio of intellectual contributions. The type of peer review journal articles should be aligned with their school’s mission. Schools with primarily teaching missions may produce more high-quality applied and pedagogical research, while schools offering research master’s and doctoral degrees are expected to produce a greater percentage of high-quality basic research. • A significant cross section of faculty in the school and each discipline is engaged in the production of intellectual contributions, relying heavily on participating faculty. • The school assesses and evaluates the quality of its intellectual contributions and has clarity on its future direction. • The school has policies that guard against publishing in predatory journals. 8.2 Collaboration with Stakeholders • Systems, processes, and resources are in place to support engagement with relevant external stakeholders by the school, units within the school, faculty, and learners. These engagements produce credible knowledge, contribute to new venture creation, and/or create commercialization opportunities that ultimately are useful for external communities, apply to the practice of business, and address real issues in society. The collaborations with stakeholders contribute to the school’s reputation as a thought leader in its desired area. 8.3 The Societal Impact of Intellectual Contributions • The portfolio of intellectual contributions contains exemplars of research and publications that have a positive societal impact that is consistent with the school’s mission and strategic plan.
