1,AACSB Standards on sustainability,"Sustainability is mentioned throughout the standards, schools must demonstrate the ability to sustain appropriate appropriate resources to achieve their operational and strategic goals for the foreseeable future","The AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) has established standards on sustainability that schools must adhere to in order to attain and maintain participating supporting status. These standards are periodically reviewed to ensure they reflect a focus on continuous improvement.

One of the criteria for attaining participating supporting status is the sufficiency of faculty members. The school must have faculty members who are actively participating and supporting the mission of the school. The criteria for faculty sufficiency should be documented and consistent with the mission of the school. The school may adapt guidance based on their specific situation in developing and implementing criteria that indicate they are meeting the spirit and intent of the standard.

In addition to faculty sufficiency, the criteria for attaining participating supporting status also address the depth and breadth of activities expected within a typical AACSB accreditation review cycle. These activities should be maintained to demonstrate ongoing commitment to sustainability.

Furthermore, participating faculty members are expected to deliver at least 75 percent of the school's teaching globally, across the entire accredited unit. Additionally, faculty members should deliver at least 60 percent of the teaching within their discipline, regardless of whether the school offers degrees, majors, concentrations, or other programs in that discipline.

It is important to note that these criteria are periodically reviewed to ensure they reflect the evolving expectations and best practices in sustainability education.

Overall, the AACSB standards on sustainability encompass a range of criteria and activities that schools must meet to attain and maintain participating supporting status. By adhering to these standards, schools can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and continuous improvement in business education.

3,Standard 5 specifies a systematic process for assurance of learning. What do peer review teams usually expect in determining whether this standard is met?,"The assurance of learning process is designed to ensure systematic continuous improvement of curriculum. Peer review teams will seek evidence that shows competencies for each degree program are in place. The standard does not describe what a school must do to have a “mature” AoL system. While a robust AoL system will have multiple competency goals for each degree program, AACSB does not prescribe an optimal number of competencies for a given degree program. Typically, schools will close the loop at least once in their accreditation cycle for each competency. AACSB interprets closing the loop to mean that a school shows how curriculum was improved as a result of the assurance of learning process. Results of the assessment should be documented and available for peer review teams upon request. The assessment processes and results should lead to documented continuous improvement in curriculum. Table 5-1 is mandatory for schools in the initial accreditation process and optional for schools completing their CIR report.  However, all schools are encouraged to complete Table 5-1 as it presents assurance of learning data in an organized and standardized way for the benefit of the school and peer review team.","Peer review teams usually expect several key elements in determining whether Standard 5, which specifies a systematic process for assurance of learning, is met. These expectations are based on the evidence provided by the school and its programs.

Firstly, the peer review teams expect the school to identify learning competencies for its business degree programs. These competencies should align with the school's mission and strategies, as well as reflect the expectations of stakeholders. The school should have a clear understanding of what knowledge, skills, and abilities students should acquire through their degree programs.

Secondly, the peer review teams expect the school to assess these learning competencies using both direct and indirect measures. Direct measures may include exams, projects, or presentations that directly assess students' mastery of the identified competencies. Indirect measures may include surveys or feedback from employers or alumni that provide insights into students' performance and the relevance of their education.

Furthermore, the peer review teams expect the school to demonstrate that these learning competencies are achieved across all degree programs. This means that the school should have evidence showing that students in different programs are acquiring the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities. The assessment results should be systematically collected and analyzed to ensure consistency and reliability.

In addition, the peer review teams look for a systematic assurance of learning (AOL) process with faculty participation. This means that faculty members should be actively involved in the assessment and improvement of student learning. The AOL process should be well-documented and include clear procedures for collecting and analyzing data, as well as taking actions to address any deficiencies identified.

For newly launched programs, the peer review teams understand that it may take some time to establish a systematic assessment process that adequately demonstrates student learning. However, it is crucial for the school to have a robust assessment plan in place for these programs. This plan should outline how the school will gather sufficient data to demonstrate a systematic and effective process for assurance of learning.

Moreover, the peer review teams expect to see evidence of curricular improvements based on the assessment results. The school should be able to show that the AOL process has led to meaningful changes in the curriculum, ensuring that the programs are continuously improving and meeting the expected learning outcomes.

Overall, peer review teams expect the school to provide comprehensive evidence that demonstrates a systematic process for assurance of learning. This includes identifying and assessing learning competencies, achieving these competencies across degree programs, involving faculty in the AOL process, having a robust assessment plan for new programs, and making curricular improvements based on assessment results. By meeting these expectations, the school can ensure the quality and equivalence of its degree programs.

4,What are intellectual contributions,"Intellectual contributions are original works intended to advance the theory, practice,  and/or teaching of business. Further, intellectual contributions may have the potential to  address issues of importance to broader society. The contributions are scholarly in the  sense that they are based on generally accepted academic research principles and are disseminated to appropriate audiences. The school’s portfolio of Intellectual contributions may fall into any of the following categories: Basic or Discover Scholarship, Applied or Integrative/Application Scholarship, Teaching and Learning Scholarship","Intellectual contributions refer to the various outputs and contributions made by individuals within the academic and professional community. These contributions are typically categorized and evaluated based on their quality and impact. In the context of schools and educational institutions, intellectual contributions are often classified within a portfolio, which serves as a comprehensive record of an individual's work.

The categorization of intellectual contributions within a portfolio can be based on different criteria, such as the level of peer or expert review that the contributions have undergone. Peer-reviewed intellectual contributions are subject to scrutiny and evaluation by others who possess recognized subject matter expertise in the field. This process ensures that the contributions meet a certain standard of quality and credibility.

The portfolio of intellectual contributions can be further divided into three main parts. The first part consists of peer-reviewed journal articles, which are considered to be a significant and impactful form of intellectual contribution. The second part focuses on the production of high-quality and impactful intellectual contributions within the school or educational institution. This includes the processes, systems, and resources that support the production of such contributions. The third part involves assessing the impact of the school's intellectual contributions on theory, practice, and teaching in the business field.

It is important to note that the distribution of intellectual contributions across categories in the portfolio is aligned with the school's mission, strategy, aspirations, and reputation as a thought leader. This means that the types of intellectual contributions can vary across different schools and institutions, depending on their specific focus and goals.

In summary, intellectual contributions encompass a wide range of outputs and contributions made by individuals within the academic and professional community. These contributions are categorized and evaluated based on their quality and impact, with peer-reviewed journal articles being a significant component. The distribution of intellectual contributions within a portfolio is aligned with the school's mission and strategy, and the types of contributions can vary across different institutions.

5,"Must faculty members publish in order to be qualified as scholarly academic, practice academic, or scholarly practitioner?","Standard 3 provides a non-exhaustive list of activities normally expected of SA, PA, and SP status. While the standard does not specifically require publication of peer- or editorial-reviewed journal articles, schools normally are expected to have guidelines and criteria consistent with their mission and their peers. A peer review team may question a school’s criteria if it appears the criteria are not in alignment with the school’s mission and peer institutions. Note that Standard 8 does require that “A significant cross section of faculty in the school and each discipline is engaged in the production of intellectual contributions, relying heavily on participating faculty.","In order to be qualified as a scholarly academic, practice academic, or scholarly practitioner, faculty members must publish. The qualifications for faculty members are categorized into four categories, which demonstrate their current relevant intellectual capital and professional engagement in the area of teaching and support for the school's mission-related activities.

For scholarly academics (SA), faculty members are typically required to have attained a terminal degree in their field or a related area of teaching to sustain currency and relevancy. The initial classification for SA status is based on the criteria established by the school, which includes the faculty member's initial qualifications and sustained engagement activities that support the currency and relevancy of their teaching field. SA faculty members are expected to produce peer-reviewed or editorial-reviewed publications related to their field of teaching as part of their scholarship portfolio. Additionally, they may also produce publications outside of their field of teaching to support the mission-related components of the school.

Practice academics (PA) are faculty members who have attained a terminal degree in their field or a related area of teaching to sustain currency and relevancy in their professional engagement and interaction activities related to their field of teaching. PA faculty members are not required to produce publications related to their field of teaching as part of their scholarship portfolio, but they are expected to engage in sustained academic and professional activities within their area of teaching.

Scholarly practitioners (SP) are faculty members who have attained a terminal degree and have sustained academic and professional engagement within their area of teaching. They follow the same criteria as scholarly academics (SA) in terms of attaining a terminal degree and sustaining currency and relevancy in their scholarship activities related to their field of teaching. SP faculty members are also expected to produce peer-reviewed or editorial-reviewed publications related to their field of teaching as part of their scholarship portfolio. Similar to SA faculty members, they may also produce publications outside of their field of teaching to support the mission-related components of the school.

It is important to note that the criteria and policies for faculty qualifications, initial classification, and maintenance of qualified status are consistent with the mission of the school and comparable to peer schools. The discipline-global ratio minimums for SA faculty members are normally a minimum of 40 percent of the school's faculty resources, while SA, PA, SP, and IP faculty members should make up at least 90 percent of the faculty resources.

In summary, faculty members must publish in order to be qualified as scholarly academics, practice academics, or scholarly practitioners. The specific requirements for publications and sustained engagement activities vary depending on the category of faculty qualifications, but all categories emphasize the importance of current relevant intellectual capital and professional engagement in the area of teaching.

7,What are the management courses," MGMT 3101 (Applied Business Statistics), MGMT 3165 (Operations Quality & Supply Chain Management), MGMT 4195 (Strategic Management) , MGMT 4605 (Internship), MGMT 4105 (Human Resource Management) ","Management courses are a part of the degree program offered by various schools. These courses are designed to provide learners with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively manage and lead organizations. The accreditation process ensures that these courses meet the learning competencies required for a management program.

During the continuous improvement review process, schools assess the effectiveness of their management courses in meeting the learning outcomes. This assessment includes evaluating the engagement of faculty in the assurance of learning (AOL) processes. The AOL processes involve evaluating learner performance and ensuring that it aligns with the expectations set by regional and country regulations, quality assurance organizations, and best practices consistent with AACSB standards.

To demonstrate assurance of learning, schools need to provide evidence that their faculty is sufficiently and meaningfully engaged in the AOL processes. This includes documenting efforts made by the school to improve learning outcomes and the systems in place to support effective continuous improvement of learner performance.

If you require more specific information about the management courses, I recommend consulting your mentor or the peer review team chair for guidance. They will be able to provide you with detailed information about the degree program structure and any specific requirements for degree equivalency.

Please note that I don't have access to specific information about the degree program structure or the management courses offered by individual schools. It is best to consult the relevant authorities or the school directly for accurate and up-to-date information.
