These expectations are based on the evidence provided by the school and its programs.\n\nFirstly, the peer review teams expect the school to identify learning competencies for its business degree programs. These competencies should align with the school's mission and strategies, as well as reflect the expectations of stakeholders. The school should have a clear understanding of what knowledge, skills, and abilities students should acquire through their degree programs.\n\nSecondly, the peer review teams expect the school to assess these learning competencies using both direct and indirect measures. Direct measures may include exams, projects, or presentations that directly assess students' mastery of the identified competencies. Indirect measures may include surveys or feedback from employers or alumni that provide insights into students' performance and the relevance of their education.\n\nFurthermore, the peer review teams expect the school to demonstrate that these learning competencies are achieved across all degree programs. This means that the school should have evidence showing that students in different programs are acquiring the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities. The assessment results should be systematically collected and analyzed to ensure consistency and reliability.\n\nIn addition, the peer review teams look for a systematic assurance of learning (AOL) process with faculty participation. This means that faculty members should be actively involved in the assessment and improvement of student learning. The AOL process should be well-documented and include clear procedures for collecting and analyzing data, as well as taking actions to address any deficiencies identified.\n\nFor newly launched programs, the peer review teams understand that it may take some time to establish a systematic assessment process that adequately demonstrates student learning. However, it is crucial for the school to have a robust assessment plan in place for these programs. This plan should outline how the school will gather sufficient data to demonstrate a systematic and effective process for assurance of learning.\n\nMoreover, the peer review teams expect to see evidence of curricular improvements based on the assessment results. The school should be able to show that the AOL process has led to meaningful changes in the curriculum, ensuring that the programs are continuously improving and meeting the expected learning outcomes.\n\nOverall, peer review teams expect the school to provide comprehensive evidence that demonstrates a systematic process for assurance of learning. This includes identifying and assessing learning competencies, achieving these competencies across degree programs, involving faculty in the AOL process, having a robust assessment plan for new programs, and making curricular improvements based on assessment results. By meeting these expectations, the school can ensure the quality and equivalence of its degree programs."}

These contributions are typically categorized and evaluated based on their quality and impact. In the context of schools and educational institutions, intellectual contributions are often classified within a portfolio, which serves as a comprehensive record of an individual's work.\n\nThe categorization of intellectual contributions within a portfolio can be based on different criteria, such as the level of peer or expert review that the contributions have undergone. Peer-reviewed intellectual contributions are subject to scrutiny and evaluation by others who possess recognized subject matter expertise in the field. This process ensures that the contributions meet a certain standard of quality and credibility.\n\nThe portfolio of intellectual contributions can be further divided into three main parts. The first part consists of peer-reviewed journal articles, which are considered to be a significant and impactful form of intellectual contribution. The second part focuses on the production of high-quality and impactful intellectual contributions within the school or educational institution. This includes the processes, systems, and resources that support the production of such contributions. The third part involves assessing the impact of the school's intellectual contributions on theory, practice, and teaching in the business field.\n\nIt is important to note that the distribution of intellectual contributions across categories in the portfolio is aligned with the school's mission, strategy, aspirations, and reputation as a thought leader. This means that the types of intellectual contributions can vary across different schools and institutions, depending on their specific focus and goals.\n\nIn summary, intellectual contributions encompass a wide range of outputs and contributions made by individuals within the academic and professional community. These contributions are categorized and evaluated based on their quality and impact, with peer-reviewed journal articles being a significant component. The distribution of intellectual contributions within a portfolio is aligned with the school's mission and strategy, and the types of contributions can vary across different institutions."}

The qualifications for faculty members are categorized into four categories, which demonstrate their current relevant intellectual capital and professional engagement in the area of teaching and support for the school's mission-related activities.\n\nFor scholarly academics (SA), faculty members are typically required to have attained a terminal degree in their field or a related area of teaching to sustain currency and relevancy. The initial classification for SA status is based on the criteria established by the school, which includes the faculty member's initial qualifications and sustained engagement activities that support the currency and relevancy of their teaching field. SA faculty members are expected to produce peer-reviewed or editorial-reviewed publications related to their field of teaching as part of their scholarship portfolio. Additionally, they may also produce publications outside of their field of teaching to support the mission-related components of the school.\n\nPractice academics (PA) are faculty members who have attained a terminal degree in their field or a related area of teaching to sustain currency and relevancy in their professional engagement and interaction activities related to their field of teaching. PA faculty members are not required to produce publications related to their field of teaching as part of their scholarship portfolio, but they are expected to engage in sustained academic and professional activities within their area of teaching.\n\nScholarly practitioners (SP) are faculty members who have attained a terminal degree and have sustained academic and professional engagement within their area of teaching. They follow the same criteria as scholarly academics (SA) in terms of attaining a terminal degree and sustaining currency and relevancy in their scholarship activities related to their field of teaching. SP faculty members are also expected to produce peer-reviewed or editorial-reviewed publications related to their field of teaching as part of their scholarship portfolio. Similar to SA faculty members, they may also produce publications outside of their field of teaching to support the mission-related components of the school.\n\nIt is important to note that the criteria and policies for faculty qualifications, initial classification, and maintenance of qualified status are consistent with the mission of the school and comparable to peer schools. The discipline-global ratio minimums for SA faculty members are normally a minimum of 40 percent of the school's faculty resources, while SA, PA, SP, and IP faculty members should make up at least 90 percent of the faculty resources.\n\nIn summary, faculty members must publish in order to be qualified as scholarly academics, practice academics, or scholarly practitioners. The specific requirements for publications and sustained engagement activities vary depending on the category of faculty qualifications, but all categories emphasize the importance of current relevant intellectual capital and professional engagement in the area of teaching."}

These courses are designed to provide learners with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively manage and lead organizations. The accreditation process ensures that these courses meet the learning competencies required for a management program.\n\nDuring the continuous improvement review process, schools assess the effectiveness of their management courses in meeting the learning outcomes. This assessment includes evaluating the engagement of faculty in the assurance of learning (AOL) processes. The AOL processes involve evaluating learner performance and ensuring that it aligns with the expectations set by regional and country regulations, quality assurance organizations, and best practices consistent with AACSB standards.\n\nTo demonstrate assurance of learning, schools need to provide evidence that their faculty is sufficiently and meaningfully engaged in the AOL processes. This includes documenting efforts made by the school to improve learning outcomes and the systems in place to support effective continuous improvement of learner performance.\n\nIf you require more specific information about the management courses, I recommend consulting your mentor or the peer review team chair for guidance.

Whitney Bunting College of Business, there are several learning objectives that are assessed. These objectives are designed to ensure that students develop the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the business field. \n\nThe learning objectives for the BBA program are as follows:\n\n1.1 Identify and evaluate ethical issues and their resolution\n1.2 Evaluate the effect of globalization and cross-culturalism in a business environment\n2.1 Apply appropriate analytical techniques in business environments\n2.2 Communicate effectively through written and oral media\n2.3 Demonstrate basic functional abilities across core business subjects\n\nTo assess the first learning objective, which is to identify and evaluate ethical issues and their resolution, student learning outcomes related to ethics from the courses CBIS 2220 Principles of Information Systems and LENB 3135 Legal Environment of Business were used. The assessment results showed that students were able to correctly identify and evaluate ethical issues. However, there was a decrease in performance in LENB 3135 in the spring semester, with only 82% of students meeting or exceeding expectations compared to 97% in the fall semester. This decrease may be attributed to the nature of the ethics question, which required independent research by the students. This question will be used again in the upcoming academic year.\n\nTo assess the second learning objective, which is to evaluate the effect of globalization and cross-culturalism in a business environment, specific assessment details were not provided in the context.\n\nTo assess the third learning objective, which is to apply appropriate analytical techniques in business environments, two courses were used: LENB 3135 and MKTG 3161. LENB 3135 assessed how well students could discuss the laws that relate to contracts, including the UCC. The assessment results showed that in the fall semester of 14-15, 80% of students met or exceeded the target, while in the spring semester, only 62% met or exceeded the target. In the following academic year, the fall semester had 74% meeting or exceeding expectations, and the spring semester had 72% meeting or exceeding expectations. MKTG 3161 assessed how well students could identify key marketing concepts and apply them to real-world business problems. The assessment results showed that in 13-14, 68% of students met the target, and an additional 16% missed by only 1 question. In 14-15, 81% of students met or exceeded the target. The same assessment was used in 15-16, and 93% of students taking both the pre and post questions scored 80% or higher on the post questions.\n\nTo assess the fourth learning objective, which is to communicate effectively through written and oral media, specific assessment details were not provided in the context.\n\nTo assess the fifth learning objective, which is to demonstrate basic functional abilities across core business subjects, two courses were used: LENB 3135 and MKTG 3161. However, it was mentioned that the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee decided to use only the ETS exam in the future to assess core business knowledge, so the assessments for LENB 3135 and MKTG 3161 will not be repeated next year.\n\nIn addition to these learning objectives, the BBA program also requires students to obtain common business knowledge (CBK) through the common business core courses. The assessment results for the CBK were not provided in the context.\n\nOverall, the undergraduate business program at the J. Whitney Bunting College of Business assesses various learning objectives to ensure that students develop the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the business field. The assessment results help identify areas of improvement and guide future curriculum development."}
