        "query": "AACSB Standards on sustainability",
        "output": "The AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) has established standards on sustainability that schools should adhere to. One of these standards is 3.1, which focuses on faculty sufficiency. According to this standard, schools are required to adopt and apply criteria that document faculty members' participation and support in line with the school's consistent mission.\n\nThe criteria should be adaptable to the specific situation of the school and should guide the development and implementation of activities that indicate the school is meeting the spirit and intent of the standard. These criteria should address the activities required to attain and maintain participating and supporting status within the typical AACSB accreditation review cycle.\n\nIt is important to note that these criteria are periodically reviewed, and the accreditation process includes a complete assessment of the degree program. Table 5.1 in the AACSB accreditation process is optional and can be used by schools for continuous improvement review. This table provides evidence of the efforts the school has made to improve learning outcomes and demonstrates that learners are meeting the learning competencies.\n\nFurthermore, the AACSB expects that faculty members are sufficiently and meaningfully engaged in the assessment of learning (AOL) processes. This means that the school should have processes in place to evaluate learner performance and ensure that faculty members are actively involved in these processes. The AACSB standards are not only focused on meeting the expectations of formalized regional or country regulations but also on the quality assurance organizations' evaluation of learner performance processes.\n\nIn summary, the AACSB standards on sustainability, specifically standard 3.1, require schools to have criteria in place that document faculty members' participation and support in line with the school's mission. These criteria should address the activities required to attain and maintain participating and supporting status, and they should be periodically reviewed. The AACSB also expects that faculty members are actively engaged in the assessment of learning processes, ensuring that learners are meeting the required competencies.",

        "query": "Our accounting department updated curriculum to include environmental impact in business risk evaluation, does this reflect the sustanability standard",
        "output": "Based on the information provided, it appears that the accounting department has updated its curriculum to include environmental impact in business risk evaluation. This is a positive step towards reflecting sustainability standards in the curriculum. By incorporating environmental impact into business risk evaluation, the accounting department is acknowledging the importance of considering sustainability factors in decision-making processes.\n\nIncluding environmental impact in business risk evaluation aligns with the broader objective of evaluating the effect of globalization and cross-culturalism in a business environment. This objective aims to equip students with the necessary skills to understand and navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by a globalized world. By considering environmental impact, students will gain a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness between business operations and the environment, which is crucial in today's globalized and environmentally conscious society.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of environmental impact in business risk evaluation also aligns with the objective of applying appropriate analytical techniques in business environments. This objective emphasizes the importance of using analytical tools and techniques to make informed business decisions. By incorporating environmental impact into the analysis, students will be able to assess the potential risks and opportunities associated with sustainability factors, thereby enhancing their analytical skills in a real-world context.\n\nIt is worth noting that the assessment results from the previous year showed that only 50% of students met the target of 75% or more correct answers in the assessment of analytical techniques related to stockholder's equity. This indicates that there is room for improvement in this area. However, the inclusion of environmental impact in business risk evaluation can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of analytical techniques, as it requires students to consider a broader range of factors in their analysis.\n\nOverall, the accounting department's decision to update the curriculum to include environmental impact in business risk evaluation reflects the sustainability standard and demonstrates a commitment to equipping students with the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate the challenges and opportunities of a globalized and environmentally conscious business environment.",

        "query": "Standard 5 specifies a systematic process for assurance of learning. What do peer review teams usually expect in determining whether this standard is met?",
        "output": "In determining whether Standard 5, which specifies a systematic process for assurance of learning, is met, peer review teams usually expect several key factors to be considered. Firstly, it is important for the program to have gathered sufficient data to demonstrate a systematic and effective process. This may be challenging for newly launched degree programs, as they may not have had enough time to establish a robust assessment plan. However, it is crucial for these programs to prioritize the development of a well-documented assurance of learning (AOL) process.\n\nThe AOL processes should include both direct and indirect measures to ensure the quality of the degree programs. Direct measures refer to assessments that directly evaluate student learning outcomes, while indirect measures may include surveys or other forms of feedback. These measures should be designed to provide evidence of student learning and should be able to demonstrate the equivalence of degree credentials.\n\nFurthermore, the results of the school's AOL work should lead to curricular process improvements. This means that the data collected through the AOL processes should inform the school's decision-making and lead to enhancements in the curriculum to better support student learning.\n\nAdditionally, programs resulting in degree credentials should be structured and designed in a way that ensures high-quality outcomes, regardless of the location or modality of instructional delivery. This means that the program should have clear guidelines and standards in place to ensure that the learning outcomes are consistent and meet the expectations of accreditation bodies.\n\nLastly, it is worth noting that microlearning credentials should be stackable or otherwise able to be combined. This means that the program should offer credentials that can be built upon or combined with other credentials, providing learners with a pathway for continuous learning and professional development.\n\nOverall, peer review teams expect the assurance of learning process to be systematic, effective, and well-documented. The program should have gathered sufficient data to demonstrate student learning outcomes, and the results of the AOL work should lead to improvements in the curriculum. Additionally, the degree credentials should be structured to ensure high-quality outcomes, and microlearning credentials should be stackable or combinable.",
