        "output": "The AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) has established standards for sustainability in business schools. These standards focus on faculty sufficiency and the criteria that schools must adopt and apply to ensure that faculty members are participating and supporting the consistent mission of the school.\n\nThe criteria for faculty sufficiency address the activities required to attain participating and supporting status. These activities should be in-depth and cover a breadth of areas expected within a typical AACSB accreditation review cycle. The criteria should also be periodically reviewed to reflect a focus on continuous improvement.\n\nTypically, participating faculty members should deliver at least 75 percent of the school's teaching globally, across the entire accredited unit. Alternatively, if the school has a specific discipline, participating faculty members should deliver at least 60 percent of the teaching within that discipline, regardless of whether the school offers a degree, major, concentration, or other programs.\n\nIn addition to faculty sufficiency, the AACSB also evaluates the effect of globalization and cross-culturalism in a business environment. While there is no specific course dedicated to international business for all BBA students, the assessment of globalization and cross-culturalism is integrated into various courses. For example, in BUAD 2172 - Business Ethics, students are required to write a paper addressing global challenges and participate in a quiz and exercise related to wealth distribution and multicultural constituencies. The minimum level of student achievement on these assessments was 90%.\n\nSimilarly, in MGMT 4145 - International Management, student learning outcomes related to globalization are assessed. Students are expected to correctly identify and evaluate the effect of globalization and cross-culturalism in a business environment.\n\nAnother objective of the BBA program is to apply appropriate analytical techniques in business environments. To assess this objective, ACCT 2101 was added to the assessment process. The assessment included nine multiple-choice questions from the final exam, some of which required calculations related to the stockholder's equity section of the balance sheet. However, the results showed that only 50% of students met the target of 75% or more correct answers.\n\nOverall, the AACSB accreditation process includes a comprehensive review of degree programs, assessment processes, and learner performance outcomes. Business schools are expected to demonstrate their efforts to improve learning outcomes and provide evidence of faculty engagement in the assessment of learning processes. The AACSB also encourages schools to consult mentors, peer review team chairs, and follow best practices to ensure effective continuous improvement in learner performance outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the AACSB standards on sustainability encompass faculty sufficiency, the evaluation of globalization and cross-culturalism, and the application of appropriate analytical techniques in business environments. Business schools are expected to meet these standards and continuously strive for improvement in order to maintain AACSB accreditation.",
