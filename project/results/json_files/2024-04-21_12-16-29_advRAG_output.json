        "query": "What are intellectual contributions",
        "output": "Intellectual contributions refer to the various outputs and contributions made by individuals within the academic and professional community. These contributions are typically categorized and evaluated based on their quality and impact. In the context of schools and educational institutions, intellectual contributions are often classified within a portfolio, which serves as a comprehensive record of an individual's work.\n\nThe categorization of intellectual contributions within a portfolio can be based on different criteria, such as the level of peer or expert review that the contributions have undergone. Peer-reviewed intellectual contributions are subject to scrutiny and evaluation by others who possess recognized subject matter expertise in the field. This process ensures that the contributions meet a certain standard of quality and credibility.\n\nThe portfolio of intellectual contributions can be further divided into three main parts. The first part consists of peer-reviewed journal articles, which are considered to be a significant and impactful form of intellectual contribution. The second part focuses on the production of high-quality and impactful intellectual contributions within the school or educational institution. This includes the processes, systems, and resources that support the production of such contributions. The third part involves assessing the impact of the school's intellectual contributions on theory, practice, and teaching in the business field.\n\nIt is important to note that the distribution of intellectual contributions across categories in the portfolio is aligned with the school's mission, strategy, aspirations, and reputation as a thought leader. This means that the types of intellectual contributions can vary across different schools and institutions, depending on their specific focus and goals.\n\nIn summary, intellectual contributions encompass a wide range of outputs and contributions made by individuals within the academic and professional community.

        "query": "Must faculty members publish in order to be qualified as scholarly academic, practice academic, or scholarly practitioner?",
        "output": "In order to be qualified as a scholarly academic, practice academic, or scholarly practitioner, faculty members must publish. The qualifications for faculty members are categorized into four categories, which demonstrate their current relevant intellectual capital and professional engagement in the area of teaching and support for the school's mission-related activities.\n\nFor scholarly academics (SA), faculty members are typically required to have attained a terminal degree in their field or a related area of teaching to sustain currency and relevancy. The initial classification for SA status is based on the criteria established by the school, which includes the faculty member's initial qualifications and sustained engagement activities that support the currency and relevancy of their teaching field. SA faculty members are expected to produce peer-reviewed or editorial-reviewed publications related to their field of teaching as part of their scholarship portfolio. Additionally, they may also produce publications outside of their field of teaching to support the mission-related components of the school.\n\nPractice academics (PA) are faculty members who have attained a terminal degree in their field or a related area of teaching to sustain currency and relevancy in their professional engagement and interaction activities related to their field of teaching. PA faculty members are not required to produce publications related to their field of teaching as part of their scholarship portfolio, but they are expected to engage in sustained academic and professional activities within their area of teaching.\n\nScholarly practitioners (SP) are faculty members who have attained a terminal degree and have sustained academic and professional engagement within their area of teaching. They follow the same criteria as scholarly academics (SA) in terms of attaining a terminal degree and sustaining currency and relevancy in their scholarship activities related to their field of teaching. SP faculty members are also expected to produce peer-reviewed or editorial-reviewed publications related to their field of teaching as part of their scholarship portfolio. Similar to SA faculty members, they may also produce publications outside of their field of teaching to support the mission-related components of the school.\n\nIt is important to note that the criteria and policies for faculty qualifications, initial classification, and maintenance of qualified status are consistent with the mission of the school and comparable to peer schools. The discipline-global ratio minimums for SA faculty members are normally a minimum of 40 percent of the school's faculty resources, while SA, PA, SP, and IP faculty members should make up at least 90 percent of the faculty resources.\n\nIn summary, faculty members must publish in order to be qualified as scholarly academics, practice academics, or scholarly practitioners. The specific requirements for publications and sustained engagement activities vary depending on the category of faculty qualifications, but all categories emphasize the importance of current relevant intellectual capital and professional engagement in the area of teaching.",

The assessment results showed that students were able to correctly identify and evaluate ethical issues. However, there was a decrease in performance in LENB 3135 in the spring semester, with only 82% of students meeting or exceeding expectations compared to 97% in the fall semester. This decrease may be attributed to the nature of the ethics question, which required independent research by the students. This question will be used again in the upcoming academic year.\n\nTo assess the second learning objective, which is to evaluate the effect of globalization and cross-culturalism in a business environment, specific assessment details were not provided in the context.\n\nTo assess the third learning objective, which is to apply appropriate analytical techniques in business environments, two courses were used: LENB 3135 and MKTG 3161. LENB 3135 assessed how well students could discuss the laws that relate to contracts, including the UCC. The assessment results showed that in the fall semester of 14-15, 80% of students met or exceeded the target, while in the spring semester, only 62% met or exceeded the target. In the following academic year, the fall semester had 74% meeting or exceeding expectations, and the spring semester had 72% meeting or exceeding expectations. MKTG 3161 assessed how well students could identify key marketing concepts and apply them to real-world business problems. The assessment results showed that in 13-14, 68% of students met the target, and an additional 16% missed by only 1 question. In 14-15, 81% of students met or exceeded the target. The same assessment was used in 15-16, and 93% of students taking both the pre and post questions scored 80% or higher on the post questions.\n\nTo assess the fourth learning objective, which is to communicate effectively through written and oral media, specific assessment details were not provided in the context.\n\nTo assess the fifth learning objective, which is to demonstrate basic functional abilities across core business subjects, two courses were used: LENB 3135 and MKTG 3161. However, it was mentioned that the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee decided to use only the ETS exam in the future to assess core business knowledge, so the assessments for LENB 3135 and MKTG 3161 will not be repeated next year.\n\nIn addition to these learning objectives, the BBA program also requires students to obtain common business knowledge (CBK) through the common business core courses. The assessment results for the CBK were not provided in the context.\n\nOverall, the undergraduate business program at the J. Whitney Bunting College of Business assesses various learning objectives to ensure that students develop the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the business field.
