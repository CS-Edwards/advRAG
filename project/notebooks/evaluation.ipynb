These standards are periodically reviewed to ensure they reflect a focus on continuous improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the criteria for attaining participating supporting status is the sufficiency of faculty members. The school must have faculty members who are actively participating and supporting the mission of the school. The criteria for faculty sufficiency should be documented and consistent with the mission of the school. The school may adapt guidance based on their specific situation in developing and implementing criteria that indicate they are meeting the spirit and intent of the standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to faculty sufficiency, the criteria for attaining participating supporting status also address the depth and breadth of activities expected within a typical AACSB accreditation review cycle. These activities should be maintained to demonstrate ongoing commitment to sustainability.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, participating faculty members are expected to deliver at least 75 percent of the school's teaching globally, across the entire accredited unit. Additionally, faculty members should deliver at least 60 percent of the teaching within their discipline, regardless of whether the school offers degrees, majors, concentrations, or other programs in that discipline.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to note that these criteria are periodically reviewed to ensure they reflect the evolving expectations and best practices in sustainability education.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the AACSB standards on sustainability encompass a range of criteria and activities that schools must meet to attain and maintain participating supporting status.

       "  'ground_truths': 'The assurance of learning process is designed to ensure systematic continuous improvement of curriculum. Peer review teams will seek evidence that shows competencies for each degree program are in place. The standard does not describe what a school must do to have a “mature” AoL system. While a robust AoL system will have multiple competency goals for each degree program, AACSB does not prescribe an optimal number of competencies for a given degree program. Typically, schools will close the loop at least once in their accreditation cycle for each competency. AACSB interprets closing the loop to mean that a school shows how curriculum was improved as a result of the assurance of learning process. Results of the assessment should be documented and available for peer review teams upon request. The assessment processes and results should lead to documented continuous improvement in curriculum. Table 5-1 is mandatory for schools in the initial accreditation process and optional for schools completing their CIR report.  However, all schools are encouraged to complete Table 5-1 as it presents assurance of learning data in an organized and standardized way for the benefit of the school and peer review team.',\n",

These expectations are based on the evidence provided by the school and its programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, the peer review teams expect the school to identify learning competencies for its business degree programs. These competencies should align with the school's mission and strategies, as well as reflect the expectations of stakeholders. The school should have a clear understanding of what knowledge, skills, and abilities students should acquire through their degree programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, the peer review teams expect the school to assess these learning competencies using both direct and indirect measures. Direct measures may include exams, projects, or presentations that directly assess students' mastery of the identified competencies. Indirect measures may include surveys or feedback from employers or alumni that provide insights into students' performance and the relevance of their education.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the peer review teams expect the school to demonstrate that these learning competencies are achieved across all degree programs. This means that the school should have evidence showing that students in different programs are acquiring the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities. The assessment results should be systematically collected and analyzed to ensure consistency and reliability.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the peer review teams look for a systematic assurance of learning (AOL) process with faculty participation. This means that faculty members should be actively involved in the assessment and improvement of student learning. The AOL process should be well-documented and include clear procedures for collecting and analyzing data, as well as taking actions to address any deficiencies identified.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor newly launched programs, the peer review teams understand that it may take some time to establish a systematic assessment process that adequately demonstrates student learning. However, it is crucial for the school to have a robust assessment plan in place for these programs.

       "  'ground_truths': 'Intellectual contributions are original works intended to advance the theory, practice,  and/or teaching of business. Further, intellectual contributions may have the potential to  address issues of importance to broader society. The contributions are scholarly in the  sense that they are based on generally accepted academic research principles and are disseminated to appropriate audiences. The school’s portfolio of Intellectual contributions may fall into any of the following categories: Basic or Discover Scholarship, Applied or Integrative/Application Scholarship, Teaching and Learning Scholarship',\n",
       "  'answer': \"Intellectual contributions refer to the various outputs and contributions made by individuals within the academic and professional community. These contributions are typically categorized and evaluated based on their quality and impact. In the context of schools and educational institutions, intellectual contributions are often classified within a portfolio, which serves as a comprehensive record of an individual's work.\\n\\nThe categorization of intellectual contributions within a portfolio can be based on different criteria, such as the level of peer or expert review that the contributions have undergone. Peer-reviewed intellectual contributions are subject to scrutiny and evaluation by others who possess recognized subject matter expertise in the field. This process ensures that the contributions meet a certain standard of quality and credibility.\\n\\nThe portfolio of intellectual contributions can be further divided into three main parts. The first part consists of peer-reviewed journal articles, which are considered to be a significant and impactful form of intellectual contribution. The second part focuses on the production of high-quality and impactful intellectual contributions within the school or educational institution. This includes the processes, systems, and resources that support the production of such contributions. The third part involves assessing the impact of the school's intellectual contributions on theory, practice, and teaching in the business field.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the distribution of intellectual contributions across categories in the portfolio is aligned with the school's mission, strategy, aspirations, and reputation as a thought leader.

Additionally, they may also produce publications outside of their field of teaching to support the mission-related components of the school.\\n\\nPractice academics (PA) are faculty members who have attained a terminal degree in their field or a related area of teaching to sustain currency and relevancy in their professional engagement and interaction activities related to their field of teaching. PA faculty members are not required to produce publications related to their field of teaching as part of their scholarship portfolio, but they are expected to engage in sustained academic and professional activities within their area of teaching.\\n\\nScholarly practitioners (SP) are faculty members who have attained a terminal degree and have sustained academic and professional engagement within their area of teaching.
